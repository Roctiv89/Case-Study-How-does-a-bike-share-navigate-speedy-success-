# How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

This case study has been proposed in the course *Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study* from Coursera.

To see the procedures and results of the project you can download the html version of the report and open it in your browser. 

If you want to follow the step by step procedure in R, you can download the rmd format of the report. Data size is too huge that can't be uploaded in the repository, but you should be able to download it from the original source:

Data source: <https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>.

Data licence agreement: <https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement>.

I have used the data from January to December 2022, you'll need to redo the procedure if you use a different frame of time, but it should be pretty similar (remember to change the workspace folder  in the 2nd chunk of the document).

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question!
